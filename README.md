# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project predicts diabetes using machine learning models such as SVM, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree. After data cleaning, robust scaling, and oversampling, models are trained and combined using a Voting Classifier to improve accuracy. The system can test real cases and save trained models.
